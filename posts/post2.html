      <h1 class="post-title">Week 5: Panoticism</h1>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>
          The concept of panopticism, introduced by Michel Foucault, remains highly relevant in this week’s readings even though the original panopticon was never physically completed. In <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, Foucault explains how power works most effectively when people regulate their own behaviour because they believe they might be watched. Surveillance does not need to be constant or visible; the possibility of observation is enough to encourage self-discipline.
        </p>

        <p>
          This idea is expanded in the digital age through Siva Vaidhyanathan’s concept of the cryptopticon. Unlike the panopticon, which relies on visibility, the cryptopticon operates invisibly through algorithms, data tracking, and platform surveillance. Individuals often do not know who is collecting their data, what information is gathered, or how it is used to influence their behaviour. As a result, surveillance becomes harder to recognize and resist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, the readings show that modern surveillance no longer depends on physical control or force. Instead, it functions through convenience, personalization, and participation. People willingly share information online and adjust their behaviour based on what they think others can see. This makes the system highly efficient, as individuals voluntarily take part in maintaining it.
